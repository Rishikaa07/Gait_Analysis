      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Reverse walking (backward walking) is a complex motor task that challenges balance,
        proprioception, and motor coordination. It has gained interest in both clinical rehabilitation
        and gait research due to its potential to reveal hidden deficits in neuromuscular control
        and biomechanical adaptation.
      </p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding reverse walking provides insight into compensatory mechanisms under constrained
        gait conditions. It also serves as a diagnostic and rehabilitative tool for identifying early
        balance impairments, making it highly valuable in neurorehabilitation and athletic training.
